The Google Drive file module enable a teacher to create a new file of type: Document, Presentation, SpreadSheet or MindMup (Mindmap)
On the teacher's own Google account, and give writing or commenting permissions to some or all the students in the course.
Student's must have a Google account for getting write access, and any other type of email for just making comments.

Initially, when starting a new document, a teacher will be asked to approve "offline" permission for the Moodle to create and manage
 the new files in the teacher's Google drive account. the permission is good for X amount of time and will expire afterwards, at that time
 the teacher will be ask to extent his/her permission for Moodle to act on his/her behalf again.
